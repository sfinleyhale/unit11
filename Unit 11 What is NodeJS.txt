Node.js is a server-side programming language that uses the JavaScript framework. It is asynchronous, which means it can execute multiple tasks at once, without needing to wait for each individual task to complete before moving to the next one. Node.js is easy to scale, making it a good choice for developing prototypes as it provides less time between updated versions of a project.
